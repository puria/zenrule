Zenrule is a registry of smart rules/smart contracts written in natural English language. It also behave as an restful API
server.

Zenroom and Zenrule are software in **ALPHA stage** and are part of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.

#### `/rules/list => [{_id, name, content}]`
Returns all the available smart rules in the system

#### `/rules/post {name, content} => _id`
Creates a new rule and return the ObjectId of the new entity

#### `/rules/put {_id, [name, content]}`
Edit a given smart rule with new values

#### `/rules/delete {_id}`
Deletes a smart rule by it's `_id`
